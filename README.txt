#Mystery Organism

This project creates a random batch of 30 mysterious *p.Aequor* organisms, then lets you play around with it!

You can randomly **mutate** a DNA base, **compare** genomes of two different *p.Aequor* organisms or check if a specimen has the **right genes** to give it a better chance of survival.

###Created for educational purposes

Feel free to **download** the code, **play** around with it and **edit** it for your own non-commercial use.

Created with vanilla JS during the learning process, and shared for other learners.

Feel free to review the code or get in touch to collab:)
